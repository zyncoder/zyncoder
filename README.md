- Embarked on a quest for a B.E. in Computer Science Engineering, learned nothing from the course but a tonne about life.

## The Entrepreneurial Era

**December 19, 2021 - Present: Founder, Zyncoder**  
- Created a community for programmers, designers, and creators, united by their love for innovation and fear of deadlines.
- Honed community-building skills, realizing that sometimes you just need a support group to brainstorm with.

**April 2023 - Present: Co-Founder, Unial**  
- Launched a public speaking and business communication academy, helping people find their voice, one "um" at a time.

## The Corporate Chronicles

*Project 1: Daltron PNG's Data Platform*  
- Enhanced data visibility, decision-making speed, performance, and quality. Also, made pretty graphs.

*Project 2: Data Platform for NSW Ports Operations Hold Co Pty Limited*  
- Improved data processing efficiency, accuracy, and user satisfaction. Made data great again.
- Mastered data pipeline creation and stakeholder engagement, learning that data is the new oil (but less flammable).

## The Skill Acquisition Saga

- Mastered the languages of SQL, databases, APIs, system architecture, and mobile platforms. Became fluent in geek.
- Wielded tools like Figma, Jira, Mixpanel, Google Analytics, MS Excel, Power BI, and Microsoft Fabric. Assembled an arsenal of digital wizardry.
- Developed soft skills in public speaking, negotiation, critical thinking, research, logical and analytical skills, and systematic problem-solving. Became a Swiss Army knife, but nerdier.

## The Certification Crusade

**2021: Salesforce Developer Catalyst I**  
- Obtained the power of the force... I mean, Salesforce.

**2023: Microsoft Azure Data Engineering Associate (DP-203)**  
- Certified in making the cloud rain data.

**2024: Microsoft Azure Data Engineering Associate (DP-600)**  
- Leveled up in the art of cloud-based data engineering.

## The Lifelong Learner's Leisure
